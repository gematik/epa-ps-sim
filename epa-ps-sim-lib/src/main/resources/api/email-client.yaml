    This interface provides access to the service **Email Management** for insurants and insurance.<br/>
    
    **General conditions**:</br> 
    For all operations if applicable:
    - a section _Client_ in operation descriptions covers recommendations (informative) for clients.
    - a section _Provider_ in operation descriptions covers requirements for the server side. 
    - error responses may be extended by helpful information about the error condition in _errorDetail_

    **Prerequisites**:</br>
    The User Session shall provide 
    - name
    - role ((profession-)oid)
    - identifier (kvnr)

    of the current user (requestor) for evaluation in operations.

    All operations of this service mandate a VAU-channel and an authorized user session.</br>
    If the service Email Management is used by insurances, the management is only allowed for 
    insurants hosted by the insurance itself. 
    For access by ePA-FdV a device registration for the device used is required.

    **User Agent**:</br>
    The user agent information (x-useragent) is part of any request, even if 
    not essentially required for the operation (e.g. raw-data collection), and
    may be considered for provider internal use.

    **Email Management** allows:
    - insurants (excluding representatives) to register or update their own email address 
    - insurances to register or update the email address of an insurant hosted by the insurance

    There is only one single email address supported by the helath record system. This address 
    is always associated to a kvnr and always hosted in the "Home System" of an insurant, the 
    health record system operating health records for the insurance of a user.

    The first (initial) email address shall be provided by the insurance and subsequent changes 
    may be applied by the insurant itself or - on demand - via the insurance.
