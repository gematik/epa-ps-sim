= EPA-PS-SIM

== About The Project
Simplified triggering of operations provided by the ePA Fachmodul of the Konnektor
using a REST interface.


== Getting Started

=== Prerequisites

The epa-ps-sim requires Java 17 for usage and Git as well as Maven 3.8 to contribute

=== Modules

The project consists of four modules:

* epa-ps-sim-api (in this document referred to as "api"):
** Contains the definition of the REST interface
** Also an OpenAPI description of the api in the YAML format is generated and deployed as artifact.
* epa-fm-java-api:
** Contains Java classes generated from the WSDL description of the interfaces of ePA-FM in the Konnektor
** They are used by the lib to implement communication with the Konnektor
* epa-ps-sim-lib (in this document referred to as "lib"):
** Implements the REST interface defined in the api modul
** Library to be used by applications, which wish to expose the api.
** Transforms the data received from the client into SOAP requests of Konnektor operations,
   executes the Konnektor operation and transforms the received SOAP response into a response to return to the client
*** Makes heavy use of the link:https://github.com/gematik/lib-ihe-xds[lib-ihe-xds] to do so.
** The lib itself does provide interfaces for its configuration, which the using application has to use to enable the libs functionality
* epa-ps-sim-app
** Spring Boot application exposing the api and using the lib to provide a stand-alone solution
** For more information read the link:epa-ps-sim-app/Readme_epa-ps-sim-app.md[Readme] of the app.

=== Installing

The easiest way for a maven project is to simply add the dependency.

Just the api:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>de.gematik.epa</groupId>
      <artifactId>epa-ps-sim-api</artifactId>
      <version>x.y.z</version>
    </dependency>

or the lib:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>de.gematik.epa</groupId>
      <artifactId>epa-ps-sim-lib</artifactId>
      <version>x.y.z</version>
    </dependency>
